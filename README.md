# AI-Memory-Game-using-Knowledge-Base
## OBJECTIVE
This game is a remake of the classic Memory game, also known as matching cards game. We tried to make a 2-player game, so that the User and AI can compete against each other. Among the User and AI, the one who gets maximum number of matched cards is declared as the winner.

## ALGORITHM
The core AI concept behind this game is the use of a Knowledge Base, as taught in Harvard's CS50 AI course ([Week 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/weeks/1/)). In this game, the AI leverages a Knowledge Base to strategically select cards, increasing its chances of winning.
The main concept of AI behind this game is the use of Knowledge Base taught in Harward's CS50 course video . In our case AI uses Knowledge Base to choose cards which increases the chances of winning for AI.

## Project Structure  

- **`runner.py`** – This script is used to play the game. It handles game execution and user interaction.  
- **`knowledge_logic.py`** – Implements the Knowledge Base concept, allowing the AI to make strategic decisions based on learned information.  

## How to Play  

For detailed instructions on how to play the game and how the AI makes its decisions, refer to the **AI_project_summary.docx** file included in this repository.
